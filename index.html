                        Anthony Brown is one of the world's most celebrated creators of picture books, with classics
                        such as
                        'Gorilla' and 'Voices in the Park'.

                <blockquote class="designer-quote">"I’ve been asked so many questions over the years it’s hard to think
                    of
                    any new ones. My favourite question I’ve ever been asked was from a child who asked, “Is Willy a
                    real
                    person or did you make him up?” (Willy looks like a chimpanzee dressed in human clothes). I think
                    that
                    child knows who Willy really is.</blockquote>
